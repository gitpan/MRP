To install, cd to the directory that contains this README file and
type the following:

 perl Makefile.PL

If you wish to install this bundle somewhere other than the default
location then type something like:

 perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl

Then to build run make

 make

You can then test the module with

 make test

If you have write access to the install directory (or the one
specified by PREFIX) then you can now type:

 make install

Presuming that the install target is in your PERL5LIB path then you
are now ready to use MRP::BaseClass, MRP::Interface, MRP::Text and
MRP::Introspection.

MRP::BaseClass - An advanced base class that supports delegation,
scalar member fields, array and hash member fields, object reference
member fields, class static variables and many other things.

MRP::Interface - You can now define an interface that a package must
support without using inheritance, and have it checked at compile
time! When used in conjunction with MRP::BaseClass, you get all the
benefits of late binding with robust type checking.

MRP::Text - A couple of text formatting routines. Nothing special

MRP::Introspection - Ever wondered what variables were in the package
of an object? Do you have problems calling a parent classes AUTOLOAD
from within an AUTOLOAD method? Do you want to modify some other
package's ISA array?  Just plain curious about what the symbol table
contains? These and many more questions can be answered, and with all
your code compiling under 'use strict'!
